## Roadmap for Bug Bounty Hunter

![326617819-6b058744-7c4c-47ee-b1de-ce7a261d67d5 (1) (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/908694d7-1a2c-4f0c-a614-17d9e48c2301)

Bug bounty hunting is a constantly evolving field where participants are continuously learning and adapting as they progress. There isn’t a specific milestone or achievement that indicates you’re ready to start finding bugs, which can make it challenging for newcomers to navigate, especially without a clear path to follow.

This roadmap is designed to help you build a strong foundation in bug bounty hunting and gradually move on to more profitable programs with higher payouts.

### 1. **The Mindset of a Bug Bounty Hunter and Continuous Learning**

Before diving into the technical aspects, it's essential to adopt the right mindset. Bug bounty hunting requires perseverance, creativity, and a never-give-up attitude. The "hacker mindset" is all about approaching problems with curiosity and determination. You’ll face many challenges and failures, but each setback is an opportunity to learn and improve.

**Understanding Code and Learning Continuously**

Understanding how code works is crucial, though you don’t necessarily need to be an expert coder. What’s more important is knowing how to analyze and manipulate code to find vulnerabilities. While learning to code can enhance your ability to understand and exploit vulnerabilities effectively, the focus should be on understanding the application’s behavior and how to identify potential weaknesses.

Bug bounty hunting is a field with no fixed endpoint of knowledge. New vulnerabilities and techniques are constantly emerging, so continuous learning is vital. Commit to exploring new research, following experts, and engaging with the community to stay updated. Join forums, [discords](https://discord.gg/bugbounty), watch YouTube channels, and participate in discussions to enhance your skills and knowledge regularly.

### 2. **Building a Strong Foundation**

If you're new to IT, start by building a solid foundation in basic IT and web application concepts. This will make your journey much smoother. Understanding web technologies, how websites are structured, and how data flows between clients and servers is crucial. Familiarize yourself with HTML, JavaScript, HTTP, and other core web technologies.

**Basic Knowledge You Should Acquire:**
- **Networking:** Understanding TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP protocols.
- **Web Technologies:** Basics of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and server-side languages.
- **Common Vulnerabilities:** Familiarize yourself with the OWASP Top Ten, which covers the most critical security risks to web applications.

You can acquire this knowledge for free on TryHackMe. (Skip this if you already have the foundational skills mentioned.)

**Step 1:** Register on [Tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/)
- **Objective:** Get the initial IT and web app knowledge
- **Actions:** Complete the following courses
  - [ ] [Complete Beginner](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/beginner)
  - [ ] [Web Fundamentals](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/web)
  - Feel free to explore additional topics if you wish.

### 3. **Selecting and Exploring a Bug Bounty Program**

Choosing the right bug bounty program is crucial for your success. Instead of diving into high-profile programs like Facebook or Google right away, it's best to start with platforms that have a lower barrier to entry, such as OpenBugBounty. These platforms are less competitive and provide a better learning environment for beginners.

When selecting a program, look for one that interests you and has a broad scope, including multiple URLs and functionalities like login features, purchasing options, or search capabilities. A well-chosen program will offer plenty of opportunities for exploration and learning.

It's also important to thoroughly read and understand the program's policies before you begin. Knowing the rules will help you stay within legal boundaries and focus your efforts on areas that are most likely to yield results.

**Step 1:** Register on [OpenBugBounty](https://www.openbugbounty.org/)
- **Objective:** Research a program that you find interesting and have a decent scope (Multiples URLs, and functionalities)
- **Actions:**
  - [ ] Explore the available programs inside OpenBugBounty.
  - [ ] Select a program.

**Step 2:** Enroll in [PortSwigger Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/dashboard)
- **Objective:** Enhance your web pentesting skills.
- **Actions:**
  - [ ] Explore the courses available on Burp Suite Academy.
  - [ ] Explore the following [paths](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-topics) and start with what seems to you the most interesting:
    - [ ] Server-side vulnerabilities
    - [ ] Cross-site scripting (XSS)
    - [ ] File upload vulnerabilities
    - [ ] Clickjacking (UI redressing)
    - [ ] Path traversal
    - [ ] Server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks
    - [ ] Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
    - [ ] Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
    - [ ] API testing
    - [ ] Web cache deception
    - [ ] SQL injection
    - [ ] NoSQL injection
    - [ ] Authentication vulnerabilities
    - [ ] WebSockets vulnerabilities
    - [ ] ...
  - Apply what you learn directly to your selected program.

### 4. **Phases of Bug Bounty Hunting**

Bug bounty hunting involves several key phases, each requiring a different skill set:

- **Reconnaissance:** Gathering information about your target. This phase involves mapping out the attack surface and identifying potential entry points.
- **Scanning:** Using tools to automate the process of finding vulnerabilities. Tools like Nmap, Burp Suite, and others can help you identify weaknesses in the target application.
- **Exploitation:** Once a vulnerability is found, the next step is to exploit it to understand its impact fully. This phase requires creativity and a deep understanding of the underlying technologies.
- **Reporting:** The final phase involves documenting your findings and submitting a clear, concise report. A well-written report can make the difference between a successful submission and one that is rejected or deemed low priority.

### 5. **Starting Small and Progressing**

**Starting with the Easiest Bugs**

As a beginner, focus on finding the easiest bugs first. These are typically low-hanging fruit that are more common and easier to identify. Here are a few examples:

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by others.
- **Security Misconfigurations:** Issues like unnecessary services being enabled or default accounts being left active.
- **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** Accessing unauthorized data by manipulating the input in the URL.

Starting with these easier bugs helps build confidence and hone your skills for tackling more complex vulnerabilities later on.

**Progression Roadmap**

Progression in bug bounty hunting should be gradual and deliberate. Here’s a suggested roadmap:

1. **Start Small:** Begin with simple vulnerabilities and smaller programs. Focus on platforms with less competition, like OpenBugBounty.
2. **Build Your Skills:** Use resources like PortSwigger Academy to deepen your understanding of web security.
3. **Increase Complexity:** As you gain experience, tackle more complex vulnerabilities and move to larger, more lucrative programs.
4. **Stay Updated:** Constantly learn and adapt to new security trends and techniques.
5. **Collaborate:** Partner with other hunters to expand your skill set and discover more bugs.

### 6. **The Importance of Collaboration**

Collaborating with others in the bug bounty community can significantly boost your progress. Working with more experienced hunters allows you to learn new techniques, share tools, and even co-author reports. The collective knowledge of a team can uncover bugs that you might have missed working alone.

Joining forums, participating in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, and engaging in community events are great ways to meet other hunters and start collaborating.

### 7. **Time Management and Setting Realistic Expectations**

Effective time management is crucial in bug bounty hunting. The pursuit of finding vulnerabilities can be time-consuming and challenging, so it's essential to set real
